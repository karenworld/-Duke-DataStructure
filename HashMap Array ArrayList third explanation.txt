When I said the code adds variable2 to the value of variable1 using the .add() method, 
I was explaining that the line of code you posted will call .add(variable2) on the value of 
variable1 in the hashmap. This worked because your keys were Strings and your values were 
Arraylists. In the example variable1 was a key and variable2 was whatever you want to add to 
the value (remember this is an arraylist) of variable1 in the map.
