The simplest approach would be to generate an ArrayList of all the possible numbers you want to use, the shuffle them with Collection.shuffle. Then just iterate over the list.

EDIT: Your question is really unclear now, given that you've said you don't want the questions in a random order... whereas your sample code appears to be trying to present the questions in a random order. Anyway... here's what I was suggesting:

List<Integer> indexes = new ArrayList<Integer>();
for (int i = 0; i < types.length; i++) {
     indexes.add(i);
}
Collections.shuffle(indexes);

for (Integer index : indexes) {
    question.setText(types[index]);
    getAnswers(index);
    // Now do something else? It's unclear...
}
