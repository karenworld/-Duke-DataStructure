When you are choosing words, you will need to use a loop 
to make sure you don't use a word that has been used already: 
choose a word, 
if it hasn't been used already use it, otherwise choose a word, 
if it hasn't been used already use it, otherwise choose a word... etc

What kind of loop do you think you will need? 
Think about whether you know how many times the loop will need to run. 
When can the loop stop running? How can you check this?

Hope that helps get you on the right track!
